# Project for Code Academy Berlin.

## This project is the final part of my first module with Code Academy Berlin.

The goal is to become familiar using React Router, Hooks, and Context, as well as implementing a basic login and document storage functionality with Firebase.

I used the REST Countries API in order to create a travel blog website where users can see and explore different countries information. They are able to view different countries details and the reviews other travelers have left on the specific country. If the user registers, then they will be able to leave reviews as well as save countries they wanna visit in the future to their bucket list.
